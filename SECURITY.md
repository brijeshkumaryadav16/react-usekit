## Reporting a Vulnerability

The react-usekit team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in react-usekit, please report it to us
through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull
requests.**

Instead, please send an email to security@react-usekit.dev (or your actual email).

Please include as much of the following information as possible to help us better understand and
resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After submitting a report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Updates**: We will send you regular updates about our progress. If you don't hear from us
   within 48 hours, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

3. **Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical security vulnerabilities within 7 days and other
   security issues within 30 days.

4. **Disclosure**: Once the issue is resolved, we will work with you on the timing and method of
   public disclosure.

## Security Best Practices

When using react-usekit:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of react-usekit to ensure you have the latest
   security patches.

2. **Validate Input**: When using utilities that process user input, always validate and sanitize
   the data.

3. **Follow React Security**: Follow React's security best practices when using our hooks.

4. **Report Issues**: If you notice any security issues or have concerns, please report them
   promptly.

## Bug Bounty Program

We do not currently have a bug bounty program, but we deeply appreciate security researchers who
help us keep react-usekit secure.

## Recognition

We will acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us in our
release notes and security advisories (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).
