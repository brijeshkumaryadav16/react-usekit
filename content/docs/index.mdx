React usekit is a collection of production-ready React hooks and utilities that you can copy and paste into your apps.

It features essential hooks for state management, API calls, form handling, and common UI patterns that every React developer needs.

## Philosophy

**I believe that great React code should be simple, reusable, and performant.** Most developers end up writing the same custom hooks repeatedly across different projects.

React usekit solves this by providing battle-tested implementations that you can:

- Copy directly into your project
- Customize to fit your exact needs
- Use without adding dependencies

**No more reinventing the wheel.** Instead of spending time writing `useLocalStorage` for the hundredth time, just copy it from React usekit and focus on building your actual product.

**TypeScript-first approach.** Every hook comes with comprehensive type definitions, giving you a better developer experience and catching errors before they reach production.

The copy-paste approach means you own the code completely. No version conflicts, no breaking changes from updates, no bundle bloat from unused features.
